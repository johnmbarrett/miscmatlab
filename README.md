# miscmatlab
Miscellaneous MATLAB code

Misc MATLAB for doing neuroscience type stuff, most specific to my work in the Shepherd Lab.  Mostly useless to anyone but me, but feel free to look around.  Anything that does eventually become generally useful or otherwise important to share will eventually be moved into a separate repository.

No branches we commit directly to master like men
