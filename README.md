Miscellaneous MATLAB code

Misc MATLAB for doing stuff, mostly to do with video analysis and/or calcium imaging data.  Currently a bit disorganised.  Mostly specific to my current projects but some of it might be refactored into general-purpose libraries at some unspecified point in the future, at which point it will probably move out of this repository.

Files of note:

* multiFactorPlot: takes some data in sort of anovan format and plots it in multiple subplots/figures.  Very flexible in that you can override both the plot function and the layout function.  Currently only support a numeric groups argument, not a cell array.
* safeInputParser: like inputParser, but warns and uses the default value when parameters don't pass validation.  Very dirty.
* logMatlabError: doesn't actually log a MATLAB error, but rethrows it as a warning

Subfolders:

* acid: Analyse Calcium Imaging Data.  Relies heavily on TIFFStack from https://bitbucket.org/DylanMuir/twophotonanalysis/
* respiratoryTracking: mostly useless to anyone but me
* videoAnalysis: see above
* qcam: functions for working with .qcamraw files generated by QImaging cameras
* vitalcam: deprecated
